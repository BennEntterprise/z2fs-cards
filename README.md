# Zero to Full Stack - O - Cards

This app was scaffolded using `npx create-react-app . --template typescript`. 
Imediately afterwards it was rigged with `redux` using `react-redux`.

You can view the standard CRA Readme. It's also [Included in this project](./docs/REACTREADME.md)

## About

As a was learning to code I reached a point where I was thought to myself... "Ok, software engineering isn't ONLY going to be about memorizing things, but there will certainly be patterns/methods/ideas/concepts that will need to be rock solid in my head."

I found myself using notebooks, scraps of paper and even index cards but at the end of the day some flash cards are where it's at.

I also realize that many developers will make a flashcard app as part of their portfolio, but I don't have one!

### Voila, a flashcard app

As someone who loves to help others learn I am going to make this app available to anyone who wants to view it. Hopefully the subjects and things I've pulled together will be useful for your learning journey too!

## About the Repo

This project is a "monorepo" meaning it will eventually contain both a front and backend, right in this one spot.
It's built using react, typescript, redux, express, node and will be deployed on a service like netlify or heroku (I just find those quick and easy).
In it's MVP there will be an ability to view a single stack of cards. Later on I'd like the ability to create extra packs and alter the cards themsleves.
