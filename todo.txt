[x] clear out exisiting react boilerplate that isn't needed



[] add colors to the lib package (so we can call them by name)
[] mock out containers:
    [] modeContainer
    [] statsContainer
    [] allDecksContainer
    [] activeCardContainer
    [] controlsContainer

Begin filling in containers:
    modeContainer
        - [] style -> color, positon, size
        - [] text that is clickable
        - [] text that has an 'isActiveClass'
        - [] redux state to switch mode.
        - [] alert on edit (sorry this feature is comming soon!)
    activeCardContainer
        - [] frontText
        - [] onClick that flips card (transform(x,y,z=180?))
        - [] backText
    controlContainer
        - [] add 3 button, in a layout.
        - [] connect buttons to proper redux state
    statsContainer
        - [] put ups some metrics that will be tracked (eventually these will all be in reudx.)
    allDecksContainer
        - [] Start the Data Model, Different file for each category.
        - [] combine all categories into one
        - [] inject combined decks into redux.
        - [] ensure x/+ will push the next card and track stats.
